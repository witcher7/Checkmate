## FOR LOOP 
> ## This loop is used when the user has a range or limit. The user knows when to stop the loop from acting.

```
       variable  --> i <10 ( limit) ; i++
                                    ## INCREMENTER
for ( int i = 0; i<10;i++){
 
  System.out.println(i) } will print the stuff
} 
```


## ARRAY
Data structure having more than one same element 
```
 int arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
 for (int i :arr){
 ðŸ˜„## we dont need to worry about values
     System.out.println(i);
}
// for each is available only for array!
}
}
```

## WHILE LOOP
> ## This loop is used when we only know that the condition will run till it is true as we dont have proper knowledge till when the loop will work

```
int i = 10;
while (i >=1 ) {
  System.out.println(i);
  i--; # we are decreasing so that they can move ahead or move less for fine tuning
}

```

## DO WHILE LOOP
