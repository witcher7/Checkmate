## UNARY OPERATORS

> + --> UNARY PLUS --> NOT NECESSARY ( to show the number is positive)
> - --> UNARY MINUS --> NECCESSARY ( to show the number is negative)

## INCREMENT AND DECREMENT OPERATOR 
> ++
> + --> PreIncrement [++a] --> INCREMENT  ( increment then print )
> + --> PostIncrement [a++] --> INCREMENT ( print then increment )

> --
> - --> PreDecrement [--a] --> DECREMENT ( Decrement first then print)
> - --> PostDecrement [a--] --> DECREMENT ( Print then Decrement )

```
int a = 10;
int b = 10;
System.out.println(a++ + ++a) --> //10 + 12 == 22
System.out.println(++b); //11
System.out.println(b--); // 11 (10)
System.out.println(--b); // -10

```

## ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
> + ( Addition) --> A+B will give 30
> - ( Subtraction) --> A-B will give -10
> * ( Multiplication ) --> A * B will give 200
> / ( DIvision) --> A/B will give 2
> %  ( Modulus ) --> B %A will give 0 ( REMAINDER)

## RELATIONAL OPERATORS
> == Is Equal to   3==5 returns False
> != Not Equal to  3!=5 returns True
> > Greater Than   3>5  returns False
> < Less Than      3 <5 returns True
> >= Greater Than or Equal to   3>=5 returns false
> <= Less Than or Equal To    3<=5 returns True

## LOGICAL OPERATORS
> && (logical and) Called Logical AND Operator. If Both the operands are true, then the condition becomes true. ( A && B ) is false.
> || (logical or ) Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands are true, then the condition becomes true. ( A || B) is true.
> ! (logical not)  Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand.

## BITWISE OPERATORS  --> THESE OPERATORS give back 10 OPERATION RESULTS
> & ( AND )
> | (OR )
> ! ( NOT )
